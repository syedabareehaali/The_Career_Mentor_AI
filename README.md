# The_Career_Mentor_AI
**The Career Mentor- An Artificial Intelligence Based Career Counselor** is a web-based intelligent career guidance expert system that mimics a one-to-one meeting with a professional career counselor and supports people in developing their own career-opting competencies based on Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple-Intelligence and Carl Jung’s Theory of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The system generates a counseling report after assessing a student’s personal information, areas of interest, grades, IQ, personality, etc. This ingenious career guidance system would aid the youth in making insightful decisions regarding their ideal career path. Moreover, this selection would enhance their academic performance and ignite their interest which would assist them in staying focused on their chosen career paths. We are furnishing a platform in the form of a website to students where they have to attempt a simple test and depending on the responses provided by them, it will generate a summarized result. Our system generates the results by harnessing the newly discovered power of Machine Learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques that will map students' responses to predict best-suited career choices for them.
